    A sample lookup is needed to work through the examples.  Please download the http_status.csv file which can be located under the <b>Basic HTTP Server Access Logs</b> folder at the following url: <a target="_blank" href="https://splk.it/spwdata">https://splk.it/spwdata</a>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="ls_f">Lookups</span> enable you to enrich and extend the usefulness of your event data through interactions with external resources.  In other words, it makes the ugly machine data such as user ID, building ID, and longitude and latitude coordinates, much more understandable by including more relatable things alongside them, such as a user’s first and last name, department name, building name, city, state, etc…    </p>
    <p>
    Lookup tables use information in your events to determine how to add other fields from external data sources such as static tables (CSV files), Python- and binary-based scripts, and App Key Value Store (KV Store) collections. 
    </p>
    <p>
    An example of this functionality would be a CSV lookup that takes the http <span class="ls_f">status</span> value in an event, matches that value with its definition in a CSV file, and then adds that definition to the event as the values of new <span class="ls_f">status_description and status_type</span> fields. So, if you have an event where http_status = 503, the lookup would add status_description = Service Unavailable, and status_type = Server Error to that event.
    </p>
    <p>
    Of course, there are more advanced ways to work with lookups. For example, you can:
    </p>
    <ul class="ls_list">
            <li>Arrange to have a static lookup table be populated by the results of a report.</li>
            <li>Define a field lookup that is based on an external Python script rather than a lookup table. For example, you could create a lookup that uses a Python script that returns an IP address when given a host name, and returns a host name when given an IP address.</li>
            <li>Create a time-based lookup, if you are working with a lookup table that includes a field value that represents time. For example, this could come in handy if you need to use DHCP logs to identify users on your network based on their IP address and the event timestamp.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In our exercise however, we will be enriching the HTTP Server Access logs, by using the http <span class="ls_f">status</span> value to get the <span class="ls_f">status_description</span> as mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p>
    To do this, we will create the lookup in 6 steps:
    </p>
    <ol class="ls_list">
            <li>Load the CSV lookup table file into Splunk.</li>
            <li>Verify that the lookup was loaded successfully.</li>
            <li>Configure the lookup definition that maps the existing http status field in the event to the http_status field in the lookup table file.</li>
            <li>Invoke the lookup manually in a search to test it.</li>
            <li>Configure the lookup to run automatically.</li>
            <li>Validate that the automatic lookup was created successfully.</li>
    </ol>
